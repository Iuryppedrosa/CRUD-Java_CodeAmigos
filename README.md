# Project Overview

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Java Spring Boot. The application manages student records in a PostgreSQL database. This README file provides an overview of the project and its key components.

## Quick Word
The project leverages the Spring Boot framework to rapidly develop RESTful APIs and manage database operations. It follows best practices for structuring Spring Boot applications, including separation of concerns and dependency injection.

## Spring Boot Overview
Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It offers auto-configuration, which minimizes the need for manual configuration and setup.

## Project Overview
The project implements a simple CRUD API for managing student records. It utilizes Spring Initializr for project setup, IntelliJ IDEA as the integrated development environment (IDE), and PostgreSQL as the database.

## Spring Initializr
Spring Initializr is a web-based tool for quickly generating Spring Boot projects with the necessary dependencies. It allows developers to customize project settings and dependencies before downloading the project structure.

## IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is the chosen IDE for this project. It provides powerful features for Java development, including code completion, refactoring tools, and seamless integration with Spring Boot.

## Starting The Server
The application server is started using the embedded Tomcat server provided by Spring Boot. Upon startup, the server listens for incoming HTTP requests on the specified port.

## Simple API with Spring Boot
The application exposes a simple API for CRUD operations on student records. It follows RESTful principles, with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting student records.

## Student Class
The `Student` class represents a student entity in the application. It includes attributes such as name, age, date of birth, and email address.

## API Layer
The API layer consists of controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate business logic to the service layer. Controllers are responsible for request mapping and data validation.

## Business Layer
The business layer contains service classes that encapsulate the application's business logic. They interact with repositories to perform CRUD operations on the database.

## Dependency Injection
Spring Boot utilizes dependency injection to manage the dependencies between components. Beans are automatically created and wired together by the Spring container.

## Properties file
Configuration properties are stored in the `application.properties` file. These properties include database connection details, server settings, and other application-specific configurations.

## Creating and Connecting to Database
The application connects to a PostgreSQL database for data storage. Database connection details are specified in the `application.properties` file.

## JPA and @Entity
Java Persistence API (JPA) is used for object-relational mapping (ORM). Entities are annotated with `@Entity` to map them to database tables.

## JPA in Action
JPA repositories are used to perform CRUD operations on entities. They provide methods for querying and manipulating data in the database.

## JPA Repository
The `StudentRepository` interface extends the JpaRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA. It inherits methods for basic CRUD operations.

## Saving Students
Students are saved to the database using JPA repositories. Upon saving, the database generates a unique ID for each student entity.

## @Transient
The `@Transient` annotation is used to mark fields in the `Student` class that should not be persisted to the database. These fields are transient and are not included in database operations.

## Post Mapping
The `@PostMapping` annotation is used to map HTTP POST requests to specific controller methods. It handles requests for creating new student records.

## Writing Business Logic
Business logic for CRUD operations is implemented in
